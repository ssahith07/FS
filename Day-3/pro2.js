/*
In this assignment, you will simulate the workflow of a movie booking app that 
has the following tasks:
	First Concurrent Activities:
		- Fetch available movies from the server.
		- Check user details (e.g., whether they are logged in or not).

	Sequential Activities:
		- Choose a movie to book.
		- Select showtime for the movie.
		- Make payment for the booking.
		
	Second Concurrent Activities:
		- Send confirmation email
		- Send confirmation SMS

Each task takes different amounts of time, and some tasks can happen concurrently 
while others need to happen sequentially.

Requirements:
=============
Use async/await and promises to model the system.
	Task 1: Fetch available movies from the server should take 2 seconds.
	Task 2: Check user details should take 1.5 seconds.
	Task 3: Choose a movie to book should take 1 second.
	Task 4: Select showtime for the movie should take 1.5 seconds.
	Task 5: Make payment for the booking should take 2 seconds.
	Task 6: Send confirmation email should take 1.5 seconds.
	Task 7: Send confirmation SMS should take 1 second.
Handle any errors that may occur (for example, if the booking fails).

Hint:
-----
You will need to:
Use Promise.all() for concurrent tasks.
Use await for sequential tasks.

Expected Output:
===============

Fetching available movies...
